# mysite

 A simple REST API based on Django with PostgreSQL database, developed by the response from Credicxo Tech Pvt. Ltd.
 Has login,signup,changr password and password_reset forms.
 
 I have created three groups 1. Super-admin, 2. Teacher, 3. Student based on your requirement.
 
 1.Super-admin  (who has all permissions to access the admin page) 
       
       username = charan
       password = 1234
 
 2. Teacher      (who can access the admin page with some restrictions)
       username = teja
       password = teja@123
 
 3.Student       (who can login only through the login page )
       username  =  bunny
       password = python123
       
       
       
  HOPE THIS WILL BE USEFUL FOR MY FURTHER INTERVIEW PROCESS IN YOUR PRESTEGIOUS COMPANY.
